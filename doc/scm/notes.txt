0 : NULL or pointer to pair
1 : integer occupying the rest of the word
2 : pointer to closure
3 : pointer to double
4 : pointer to utf-8 string
5 : pointer to vector

Closure
==============
func ptr
env ptr

Pair
====
car
cdr

Double
======
value

utf-8 string
============
length
data[length+1] // zero terminated

vector
======
length
data[length]
